# Caltech-101 Image Classification

This code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the Caltech-101 dataset. The code uses Keras with TensorFlow backend.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Keras 2.4.3 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4.1 or higher
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
cd <repository>
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

1. Download the Caltech-101 dataset from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/. Extract the dataset to a folder named 101_ObjectCategories.

2. Open the Jupyter notebook caltech-101.ipynb.

3. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the CNN model.

4. Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Note: The path to the 101_ObjectCategories folder can be changed in the load_dataset function.
